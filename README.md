12/11 - base functionality complete. Player can move, player cannot move beyond boundaries, 
  player's position reset if it hits or is hit by an enemy, enemies move across screen, 
  enemies reset on left after scrolling off canvas to the right. 

todo: Consider creating a single base object to handle common properties/methods of both player and enemies, then create player/enemy subclasses to
		handle properties/functions unique to each.
